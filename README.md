## Summary

This project simulates a **file system** using a **tree structure** in Python. It provides functionalities to:

- **Add directories** at any level.
- **Delete directories** and their subdirectories.
- **Display the hierarchical structure** of the directory tree.

The file system is represented using nested dictionaries, where each key is a directory and the value is either an empty dictionary (if no subdirectories) or another dictionary representing subdirectories.

### Key Features:

- **Add a directory**: Adds a directory at a specific level in the tree.
- **Delete a directory**: Removes a directory and all its subdirectories.
- **Display structure**: Displays the full directory structure in a readable format.
